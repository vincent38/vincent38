### Thanks for stopping by ! :wave:

I'm Vincent, a student in second year of graduate school in Computer Science at the Grenoble-Alpes University (France).
I am currently following the [Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble](https://mosig.imag.fr/) program, and especially the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://mosig.imag.fr/IASD/IASD) specialization.

This account is mainly used to publish my experiments, some academical works, and similar stuff.

You can also check out my personal website [here](https://aubriot.ovh/). I hope to be able to update it by the end of Q4'21, but it contains a good share of my resume, and some exclusive projects that I can't disclose directly on Github.
