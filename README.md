### Thanks for stopping by ! :wave: 

I'm Vincent, a student in second year of graduate school in Computer Science at the Grenoble-Alpes University (France).

## My studies :student:

I am currently following the [Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble](https://mosig.imag.fr/) program (Graduate School of Science in Informatics - taught in English), and especially the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://mosig.imag.fr/IASD/IASD) specialization. I've started the Master in September 2020, and I will graduate around June 2022 (if everything goes well).

This is a Master with a particulaer status, as it is managed by both the Grenoble INP Ensimag, and the Grenoble-Alpes University.

Furthermore, I have several more diplomas achieved earlier on:

- A "Diplôme Universitaire de Technologie en Informatique - DUT" (Higher National Diploma in Computer Science) between 2016 and 2018, at the University Institute of Technology of Grenoble :fr:. This is a 2-Year diploma that teaches various subjects regarding theory of computer science, project management, communication in French and English, and where practical programming exercices constitutes half of the assignments. 
- A "Diplôme d'Université d'Études Technologiques Internationales - DUETI" (University Diploma of International Technological Studies) between September 2018 and September 2019 at Kyoto University :jp:. The goal of such diploma is to allow scholars to study abroad for one year, in order to deepen their mindsets, learn more about different cultures, and expand their knowledge. During this year, I took the opportunity to learn more about not only computer science, but also (among other topics) the Japanese language and linguistics, as well as the popular culture, and some of the daily issues the country is facing. This was, my best University experience, by far.
- A "Licence 3 Informatique" (Third and last year of Undergraduate school of Computer Science), started in September 2019 and obtained in June 2020, at Grenoble-Alpes University :fr:. This year was more focused on theoretical computer science principles, such as advanced algorithmics and data structures, computer architecture, syntaxical analysis and calculus modeling. I also got the opportunity to create an activity with a team targeted towards primary school pupils to teach basics of algorithmics, but we never got the opportunity to do a run in real conditions.

## Purpose of this account :octocat:

This account is mainly used to publish my experiments, some academical works, and similar stuff.

Most of the code written there is private, for various reasons. There are no plans as of now to disclose them (but nothing is set in stone, and I don't exclude the fact of releasing old projects at some point in the future :thought_balloon: )

You can also check out my personal website [here](https://aubriot.ovh/). I hope to be able to update it by the end of Q4'21, but it contains a good share of my resume, and some exclusive projects that I can't disclose directly on Github.

## My stack :computer:

A good old "Gaming Laptop" with a Win10/Ubuntu dualboot. I'm often on the Win10 side for gaming and dev, but I tend to be as versatile as possible.
No script to automate a daily/weekly repetitive task, nor config file duplicated in a repo and ready to fire whenever I install a new computer. I always considered writing some, but I have no valid usecase that may require it (too many different things at once).

I used various languages, libraries and frameworks (languages list, not exhaustive and not in order: C, C++, HTML/CSS/PHP, Java, Python, Javascript)

## My leisure :lotus_position:

When I'm reaching my limit, I stop working and either play a video game, go out for a trip around the city by feet/bus/tramway/train (oddly specific), or I just do nothing.
Big arcade rhythm player :joystick: (sadly my nearest game center is 1+ hour away by train), especially maimai, SDVX, Jubeat, sometimes DDR and PIU.
Also a train spotter :railway_track:, not that much geek on the field, but I like to take some pictures and ride them.

## Misc.

2018-2019 in :japan: : :hotsprings::jack_o_lantern::christmas_tree::beach_umbrella::tanabata_tree: - 
Proudly completed the Tokyo to Hiroshima Local Train :train: circuit (not Shinkansen !) in around 14-15 hours.

Almost completed the Paris - Lyon - Marseille Local Train Circuit.
