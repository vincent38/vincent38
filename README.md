## My studies :student:

By chronological order

- A "Diplôme Universitaire de Technologie en Informatique - DUT" (Higher National Diploma in Computer Science) between 2016 and 2018, at the University Institute of Technology of Grenoble :fr:. This is a 2-Year diploma that teaches various subjects regarding theory of computer science, project management, communication in French and English, and where practical programming exercices constitutes half of the assignments. 
- A "Diplôme d'Université d'Études Technologiques Internationales - DUETI" (University Diploma of International Technological Studies) between September 2018 and September 2019 at Kyoto University :jp:. The goal of such diploma is to allow scholars to study abroad for one year, in order to deepen their mindsets, learn more about different cultures, and expand their knowledge. During this timeframe, I took the opportunity to learn more about not only computer science, but also (among other topics) the Japanese language and culture. This was my best University experience, by far.
- A "Licence 3 Informatique" (Third and last year of Undergraduate school of Computer Science), started in September 2019 and obtained in June 2020, at Grenoble-Alpes University :fr:. This year was more focused on theoretical computer science principles, such as advanced algorithmics and data structures, computer architecture, syntaxical analysis and calculus modeling.
- I recently followed the [Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble](https://mosig.imag.fr/) program (Graduate School of Science in Informatics - taught in English), and especially the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://mosig.imag.fr/IASD/IASD) specialization. I've started the Master in September 2020, and graduated in July 2022. This is a Master with a particular status, as it is managed by both the Grenoble INP Ensimag, and the Grenoble-Alpes University.

## Purpose of this account :octocat:

This account is mainly used to publish past academical works and personal projects. Some of them are private and there is no plan to disclose them for now.

You can also check out my personal website [here](https://aubriot.ovh/), which contains exclusive works that are not listed here !

## My stack :computer:

No script to automate a daily/weekly repetitive task, nor config file duplicated in a repo and ready to fire whenever I install a new computer. I always considered writing some, but I have no valid usecase that may require it (too many different things at once on very different environments).

I used/use/heard of various languages, libraries and frameworks (languages list, not exhaustive and not in order: C, C++, HTML/CSS/PHP, Java, Python, Javascript)

## My leisure :lotus_position:

I usually play some video games, go out for a trip around the city by feet/bus/tramway/train (oddly specific), or I just do nothing.
Big arcade rhythm player :joystick: (sadly my nearest game center is 1+ hour away by train), especially maimai, SDVX, Ongeki, Chunithm, sometimes DDR and PIU.
Also a train spotter :railway_track:, not that much geek on the field, but I like to take some pictures and ride them.
